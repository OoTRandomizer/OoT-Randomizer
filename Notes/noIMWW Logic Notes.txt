Guidelines for noIM/WW Glitched Logic

1) All in-logic tricks being considered need to be infinitely repeatable 
	with no ability to softlock the game logically by themselves
2) Obscurity is not a factor
3) Difficulty is potentially a factor.  Any trick with a reliable, bufferable setup is fine.
	If there are questions, please ask me in #dev-glitched-logic.
4) Only standard hovers will be expected for now.  Any hover which requires chus, will need chus
	in logic, and any hover which needs more than 20 bombs will not be considered without chus in logic.
5) Damage boosting to zelda will not be considered as it can lock the checks
	at lon lon ranch.


## Tricks not considered at all ##
-Item Manipulation
	BA
	RBA
	GIM

-Ocarina Items
	Can dupe over beans, losing them forever

-Equip Swap
	Bottle over Din's Fire, lost forever

-Wrong warpping
	All sorts. FWWWs, void warps, and blue warp manips included.  These are too vastly misunderstood and non-repeatable to be considered.

-Actor push clips
	Any setup with a documented video that is 100% consistent can be considered.  This video must be provided.

-Reaching zelda without moving Talon
	Getting the letter before the egg can lead to a softlock on masks, so this will not be considered



## Cleanliness ##
When writing the logic out, try to keep the logic for single tricks grouped together
by parentheses or brackets.  Any trick to be considered must be entered into the noIMWWTricks.csv
file in the Notes folder. A link to a video of the trick being performed with the suggested required
items would be appreciated, but not required.
