-- Stuff you can do that could possibly softlock -- 
Opening the vanilla Iron boots chest as child will not spawn the serenade check
and you cannot get it back.  

Duping bottles into your inventory in any way.

Getting zelda's letter and/or masks before the weird egg.  Weird egg after ZL and masks can be
irreversible in some situations so this is not considered in logic, although it is doable under the ruleset
to which this logic caters.  Do at your own risk!

Collection delay such as speedfrog and fishing gold scale


-- Other oddities --
The colossus' hands chests (vanilla silver gauntlets and mirror shield), despite residing in Desert colossus
are logically part of Spirit Temple as far as hints are concerned.  If you get a hint for WOTH spirit you may need
to check these chests, or if a Foolish Desert Colossus happens you may have items in these chests.

Where logic expects hovering is a little bit janky.  In general, commonly known hovers are included regardless of difficulty.
This includes both tektite hover to fishing and the tektite hover in DMT, spirit hover, hovering to skip pierre in fire temple.
Logical hovers will always require less than 20 bombs or with chus in logic 50 chus and will be infinitely repeatable.
Non-standard logical hovers (usually for skulls) are generally short hovers, less than 9.  There is no hard and fast
criteria, though.  Out of bounds hovers are not considered in logic at all as they can crash on N64.


Child is not logically expected to enter Fire Temple at all.  This is due to child needing fairies and many explosives to get around.
The hints can only deal with a single bottle, so you'll only ever have access to one fairy.  This may be added in the future, however
for now it's a bit "mean" to allow.
