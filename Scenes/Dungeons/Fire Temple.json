    #I put the tag "hot" as if the logic was changed so that going from one "hot" region to another "hot" region requires Goron Tunic. However, I did not do this with DMC. This was just a placeholder solution to prevent entrance rando/door rando from lining up two "hot" rooms without Goron Tunic. The door between the big lava room and elevator required Goron Tunic in the original logic but that was because of the hot rooms being adjacent and carrying over the timer.
