This is a guide to how hybridized vanilla/MQ dungeons would handle doors if the feature is ever added.
Many doors in MQ are changed to a different type of door than in vanilla.
Therefore, every door that connects a vanilla room with an MQ room must be edited.

This first section describes all combinations of mismatched door types between OoT and MQ.
There are four possible ways that a door in a hybrid dungeon could end up:
1. Both rooms have vanilla layouts
2. Both rooms have MQ layouts
3. The "front" room has the vanilla layout and the back is MQ
4. The "front" room has the MQ layout and the back is vanilla

Locked doors should be treated the same as unlocked ones because the original lock layouts can't be used in a hybrid dungeon anyway.
If a lock is added afterward then it will just overwrite whatever is there.

It is impossible to have a door use a switch on both sides, or a clear on both sides.
If both sides of a door would require this, it is necessary to pick one side to leave unbarred.

The doors are numbered in the order of "front room - back room" the way it is in vanilla even if the MQ version of the door flips it.
MQ often flips the directions of doors to allow a different type of flag. Though MQ flips some doors for no reason despite not having bars in either version. This list treats such doors as if they didn't flip because I don't think it makes a difference.

Some dungeons would have other problems with combinations of certain rooms besides door conflicts.
Particularly Jabu-Jabu because of Ruto and the tentacles.

There is a conflict with Vanilla Room 7 (branching hallways) and MQ Room 3 (under the pit). Vanilla Room 7 needs Ruto to access Room 10 and Room 11 but MQ Room 3 needs the green tentacle to be killed before Ruto can be brought out of the basement.
	1. 'Jabu Jabus Belly MQ Room 03 T13 Unbar' so that Ruto can be brought up the vanilla way
	2. 'Jabu Jabus Belly Room 07 T11 Unbar' so that Room 10 can be opened without Ruto which allows green tentacle to be killed
	3. MQ Room 9, Vanilla Room 10, Vanilla Room 8, and 'Jabu Jabus Belly Room 07 T12 Unbar' so that Room 9 is unbarred and contains the blue tentacle which opens up Room 10 with the green tentacle and the red tentacle can be reached in Room 8 with Ruto
		Alternatively: The green tentacle could be removed from MQ Room 3.
If Room 10 is vanilla and Room 8 is MQ, then both of them will contain the red tentacle, but no green tentacle. Without any way to kill the green tentacle, Room 3 must be vanilla and Room 2 must be MQ so that nothing is blocked by the green tentacle.
	Alternatively: The green tentacle could be removed from Room 2 or 3, or one of the red tentacles could be replaced.
If Room 8 is vanilla and Room 10 is MQ, then both of them will contain the green tentacle, but no red tentacle. Without any way to kill the red tentacle, Room 1 and Room 3 must both be vanilla. Room 7 must also be MQ because in vanilla the red tentacle blocks off Room 12 which has an item in it.
	Alternatively: The red tentacle could be removed from these rooms, or one of the green tentacles could be replaced.
If Room 12 is vanilla and Room 9 is MQ, then both of them will contain the blue tentacle. I don't think this would be much of a problem though.
If Room 9 is vanilla and Room 12 is MQ, then neither of them will contain the blue tentacle. Without any way to kill the blue tentacle, Room 7 must be vanilla, because in MQ the blue tentacle blocks off Room 12. The blue tentacle still blocks off Room 8 in vanilla, but that contains nothing but either the red or green tentacle. This does mean though that Room 10 has to be vanilla and contain the red tentacle, leaving no way to kill the green tentacle. So Room 3 must be vanilla and Room 2 must be MQ.
If Room 7 is vanilla and Room 10 is MQ, then the green tentacle will replace the red tentacle. Vanilla Room 7 needs the red tentacle so Room 8 and Room 9 must be MQ; MQ Room 9 has the blue tentacle which opens up MQ Room 8 with the red tentacle.
