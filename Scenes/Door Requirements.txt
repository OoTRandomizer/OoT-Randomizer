Listing requirements for each door:
Assume every door is locked and unbarred and the player has infinite keys.
For each door, list all of the doors that the player could open without opening this one. (No need to list boss doors or planes)
Then a script can check how many of the required doors have keys to determine the total amount of keys the logic requires for each door. This would ensure the player can't run out of keys.
If a door can be bypassed by going through other doors, but doing so would completely remove any possible need to go through the door in the first place, then those doors do not need to be listed as requirements.
For example, Forest Temple T03 and T15 (the doors of Room 05 Hall to Block Push Room) can be bypassed by going into Room 11 (Block Push Room) from T05 (by hovering onto West Courtyard Ledge), but because T03 and T15 serve no other purpose but to access Room 11, there would be no reason to ever open those doors if you already had access to Room 11. So T03 and T15 would not require T05, although T05 and most other doors in Forest Temple would still require T03 and T15.
Dungeons with multiple entrances have multiple requirements for each door. "Reqs from front" should be prioritized.
"Reqs from boss" would only apply if the rear entrance for the dungeon was shuffled. IGC has equivalent "Reqs from tower".
	JJB: Add T10 to all requirements, but T10 itself now only requires T01
    Forest: Same except for T01 and T24. This also only applies if the game is modified to allow the player to go from the boss door to the elevator otherwise the player can't access any of the doors from there.
    Fire: Same but T17 requires nothing
    Water: Same but T17 requires nothing
	Ganon's Tower: Shuffling the rear entrance of this wouldn't work because the series of boss doors at the end is one-way.
	Other dungeons have very different sets of requirements.
	Shadow Temple is special because the boss door has access to T04, T12, T13, T14, and T15, but can't open any other doors at all because there is no way to cross the river backwards.
There might be extra sets of requirements under the conditions that hovering or other glitches are allowed. (For example more doors in Forest Temple would require T18, the door on the raised platform on the east side of the lobby)
If door rando is ever added, it would be necessary to either disable keys, or replace this system with a script that can crawl through the world and automatically determine the exact amount of required keys.
